# bungalow
```
This Vue projet displays key data from properties in Seattle.
Users can supply a price-range, and the users will see the filtered properties.
Users can also sort the properties from low to high or high to low price.

I only displayed properties that had images because properties without images aren't that interesting for the Users.
I initially hid the API URL inside a .env hidden from git, but had to add it to the repository so that Bungalow can run the applicaiton locally.

Todo List (If I had more time)
Allow Users to filter properties by amenities and then clear filters.
Have a 'Property details' page when Users click on a property they like.
Write unit tests for Vue components.
